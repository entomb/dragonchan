                <h2>Main Goal</h2>
                <p>Dragonchan is a script that converts any /b/ thread into a dragon slaying match<p>
                <p>The script parses the thread using the json API and calculates damage/classes and other skills depending on post rolls, images, replies, etc...</p>
                <p>The main goal is to kill a dragon (or any other boss) by roleplaing on /b/ posting your hits and skills and checking the script page for damage output and fight status</p>
                <p>The game focus on cooperation, as every class depends on eachother for its full benefit, this is why we implemented a diferent set of classes and skills and balanced them in a co-dependent way.</p>
                <p>Using your class specific skills you can help eachother in the quest of defeating a dragon. if cooperation is not achived the thread will simply die by itself...</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tutorialPage" id="t_roll" style="display:none;">
                <h2>What is a roll?</h2>
                <p>
                    A 'roll' consists in the last 2 digits of your post number. Ocasionaly, some skills will use the last 2 digits of the id generated for images you post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rolls are calculated in a way that they allways return a >0 number, this means that if your last 2 digits are "00" the script will look for your last 3 digits. if you last 3 digits are still "000", the script will look for your last 4 digits. this will go on until a >1 digit is found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes people are going to burst >1000 damage in one hit, this is because 00 dubs are disabled on /b/ but 000 trips are allowed. the damage for this roll will be from 1000 to 9000. This is intended (same goes for quads "0000"). This is extremely rare but will make some "lucky" rolls enjoyable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system is only possible because /b/ has a very very very fast post per second ratio, making the last 2 digits of your post nearly random.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tutorialPage" id="t_id" style="display:none;">
                <h2>What is my ID?</h2>
                <p>
                    Your ID is a randomly generated hash that 4chan gives you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hash is unique for every thread you enter meaning it will change from thread to thread but not from post to post.This way the script can detect exactly who you are and what have you posted in a thread, thracking the damage for each ID.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your ID determinates your class. The script assigns you a class and because IDs are persistent only inside the same thread this class will change the next dragonraid thread you enter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All classes are balanced, or at least we try to make them balanced, by some being common then others. This does not mean some classes suck and others don't. Its just the way the game was designed, making the classes more or less needed.

                <p>You will be assigned a class based on your ID and the last 2 digits of every post represent the damage you do.
                   <br/>
                   You can use this webpage to track the party damage, by placing the 4chan thread ID after the URL.

                <p>
                    To start a new dragon slayer thread <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/entomb/dragonchan">copy/paste the thead template from the github repo</a> and start a new thead with the desired boss image.
                    <br/>
                    Its recomended that you post a link to the script in your second post, so new people can read and understad the rules and the game itself.

                    <span class="note">The scrip will work with any thread ID, so fell free to highjack a dead/troll thread!</span>

                </div>
                <h2>The Boss</h2>
                <p>
                    The boss has a radom HP depending on OP's roll. this allows for stronger or weaker dragons.
                    The minimum HP is now set to 16.000HP.
                </p>
                <h2>Damage</h2>
                <p>
                    Your damage is calculated based on your <a href="#t_roll">roll</a>.
                    The script will output everyone`s damage as well as other actions.
                    <br/>
                    Some skills (depending on your class) will add or remove damage to your roll.
                </p>

                    <img class="ink-l100 ink-m90 ink-s90" src="/images/howto_log.jpg"/>
                </div>

                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p>
                    When you roll under 11 you will die. this means your posts will no longer do damage until you are revived. (death knights may cheat death)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everytime someone dies, the boss will heal for a small amouth depending on the death roll. If you are a healer try reviving your falled team mates, they will thank you for that.
                </p>
                <h2>Enrage</h2>
                <p>
                    When the boss HP drops below 20% he will enrage and the minumum roll will be 22 (if you roll under 22 you die).
                    An enraged boss can not heal himself.
                </p>
                <h2>Victory</h2>
                <p>
                    The game ends when the dragon reaches 0HP.
                    By this time the script will tell you who delivered the last hit. Be noble and congratulate your new hero!
                </p>
                <h2>TOP</h2>
                <p>
                   The script keeps a sidebar with diferent TOP10 lists so you can track the raid party overall effectiveness.
                   <br/>
                   Allways keep an eye on the top damage, your ID might be there!

                </p>
                <h3>How to Revive</h3>
                <p>
                    To revive a fallen soldier you must target them (by quoting his post) and roll an EVEN number (ends in 0,2,4,6,8).
                </p>

                <div class="ink-vspace">

                </div>

                <p>
                    If the healing roll is successfull your targets will be alive again.
                    <br/>If you roll an ODD the revive ability will not trigger.
                    <br/> Your damage will still count either way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can target more than one post at once, but a player can only be revived 6 times total. Check the sidebar for "most deaths" and "fallen soldiers" too see who needs a revive.<br/>
                    The target system will only work if you quote the death post, so quoting someone asking for revival will not work unless you find where he died.

                <p>
                    Knights are a damage dealing class and also the most common class.
                    <br/>
                    Knights damage output is based on avenging and critical hit chance.
                </p>
                <h3>Critical Hit Chance</h3>
                <p>Knights critical hit if their roll ends in "0" or "5". this means the hit does double damage.</p>
                <div class="ink-vspace">

                <h3>How to Avenge</h3>
                <p>An avenging strike is a second hit for extra damage, this will allow the knigh to repeat his attack in the name of the fallen ones.</p>
                <p>
                    To avenge a fallen soldier you must target him (by quoting his post) and roll an EVEN number (ends in 0,2,4,6,8).
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    If the avenging roll is successfull you will swing your sword once again for every target.
                    <br/>If you roll an ODD the avenge ability will not trigger.
                    <br/>If your roll ends in 0 (critical hit) and you are trying to avenge someone, the avenging strike will also be a critical hit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can target more than one post at once, but a player can only be avenged 6 times total. Check the sidebar for "fallen soldiers" too see who can be avenged.<br/>
                    The target system will only work if you quote the death post, so quoting someone asking for revival will not work unless you find where he died.

                    Paladins are holy knights that can heal and avenge fallen soldiers.
                    <br/>
                </p>

                <h3>Holy Light</h3>
                <p>Paladins can shine the holy ligh upon a dead soldier, this will revive AND avenge at the same time, puting the fallen soldier back in the game and dealing extra damage.</p>
                <p>When a paladin revives, same rules apply as if he was a healer</p>
                <p>When a paladin avenges, same rules apply as if he was a knight</p>
                <p>Paladins can NOT critical hit.</p>

                <h3>How to Revive</h3>
                <p>
                    To revive a fallen soldier you must target them (by quoting his post) and roll an EVEN number (ends in 0,2,4,6,8).
                </p>

                <div class="ink-vspace">
                    <img class="ink-l100 ink-m90 ink-s90" src="/images/howto_revive.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>
                    If the healing roll is successfull your targets will be alive again.
                    <br/>If you roll an ODD the revive ability will not trigger.
                    <br/> Your damage will still count either way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can target more than one post at once, but a player can only be revived 6 times total. Check the sidebar for "most deaths" and "fallen soldiers" too see who needs a revive.<br/>
                    The target system will only work if you quote the death post, so quoting someone asking for revival will not work unless you find where he died.
                </p>


                <h3>How to Avenge</h3>
                <p>An avenging strike is a second hit for extra damage, this will allow the knigh to repeat his attack in the name of the fallen ones.</p>
                <p>
                    To avenge a fallen soldier you must target him (by quoting his post) and roll an EVEN number (ends in 0,2,4,6,8).
                </p>
                <div class="ink-vspace">

                </div>
                <p>
                    If the avenging roll is successfull you will swing your sword once again for every target.
                    <br/>If you roll an ODD the avenge ability will not trigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can target more than one post at once, but a player can only be avenged 6 times total. Check the sidebar for "fallen soldiers" too see who can be avenged.<br/>
