I`m not posting this threads, random people have been doing that. I have no control over it. If you have complains about the spam, sage the threads yourself.

If you have complains about being banned for posting too many dragon threads in one day, well, its not my fault either.

Please don`t spam with dragon threads or you will end up ruining it for other people.


Thread Template:
================
```
ITT: /b/ dragon slayer raid!

Rules:
This huge motherfucking dragon appears out of nowhere.
This thread last 2 digits x250 define its HP (plus a flat 3000)

If your ID starts with a number you are a Healer.
If your ID starts with a vowel you are a Bard.
If your ID starts with a "/" or "+" you are a Paladin.
otherwise you are a Knight
Your last 2 digits represent the damage you do
if Knight Roll ends in 5 or 0 you do DOUBLE DAMAGE
If you roll under 11 you DIE! (your posts will no longer do damage)
Bards are here to motive troops! each time they post an image the next 3 posts will do bonus damage!
Healers revive fallen soldiers by targeting them and rolling an EVEN number
Knights avenge fallen soldiers by targeting them and rolling an EVEN number. Avenging does more damage for the glory of the fallen mate.
Paladins can avenge AND revive!
you can be avenged/revived 6 times max
If you roll 00 or 69 you REVIVE everyone! their damage will count again!
The boss will enrage bellow 20% HP, the minimum roll will be 22. however, he will no longer heal himself

I have a webpage to track things, I will post a link to it here.
